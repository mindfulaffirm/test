<p><strong>Experiential</strong></p>
<p>Based on Kolb&rsquo;s Experiential Learning Theory (1999), a learner goes through a four-stage learning cycle, which includes concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualisation, and active experimentation.&nbsp; According to the theory, concrete experiences are the basis for observations and reflections. These are then assimilated and distilled into abstract concepts which would drive the</p>
<p>actions (Sternberg &amp; Zhang, 2001, p.228).</p>

<p><strong>Multimodal</strong></p>
<p>A multimodal learning approach uses various channels, facilities and tools tailored to learner needs. According to the multimedia principle, individuals learn better from words and images than from words alone (Fletcher &amp; Tobias, 2005; Mayer, 2001). As such, teachers could combine words and pictorial representations to help students better understand certain concepts when teaching. Other modes like discussion, sharing of values, knowledge, skills, feelings and behaviours could also be</p>
<p>used to advocate a dynamic, engaging, and interactive learning experience.</p>

<p><strong>Inquiry-Based</strong></p>
<p>Inquiry-based learning encourages learners to solve authentic real-world problems. It begins</p>
<p>with Orientation, followed by Conceptualisation, Investigation, and ends with Conclusion. Throughout the cycle, Discussion, which includes, Communication and Reflection, are present in all stages (Pedaste, M&auml;eots, Siiman, de Jong, Riesen, Kamp, Manoli, Zacharia &amp; Tsourlidaki, 2015). Through</p>
<p>communication, learners&rsquo; thought processes are made visible for discussion, sharing, and</p>
<p>purposeful conversation. This helps the learners understand and solve problems better.</p>

<p><strong>Connected</strong></p>
<p>Learners today are almost constantly connected socially, personally and professionally through digital and mobile devices. This approach draws the information across disciplines from multiple platforms to address the needs of learners.</p>
